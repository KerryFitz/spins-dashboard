## 📊 Common Marketing Analyses

### Analysis 1: "How is HUMBLE performing overall?"

**Dashboard Path:** Executive Overview

**Key Metrics to Check:**
- Total Sales (current period)
- YoY Growth % (should be positive)
- Distribution (ACV %) across channels
- Promotional mix (target: 20-40%)

**Red Flags:**
- Negative YoY growth for 2+ periods
- ACV declining (losing distribution)
- Promo % >50% (too dependent on promotions)

---

### Analysis 2: "Which retailers should we focus on?"

**Dashboard Path:** Retailer Performance

**Steps:**
1. View the retailer scorecard table
2. Sort by YoY Growth % (identify decliners)
3. Check "Sales vs Distribution" scatter plot
4. Look for: Low sales + High ACV = underperforming opportunity

**Action Framework:**
- **High Sales + High Growth** → Maintain, possibly expand
- **High Sales + Low Growth** → Investigate why, promotional support?
- **Low Sales + High ACV** → Marketing opportunity, increase velocity
- **Low Sales + Low ACV** → Either exit or invest in distribution

---

### Analysis 3: "Who are our main competitors?"

**Dashboard Path:** Competitive Analysis

**Steps:**
1. Select "TOTAL US - NATURAL EXPANDED CHANNEL"
2. View top 20 brands bar chart
3. Check where HUMBLE ranks
4. Review "Market Share %" table

**Competitive Intel:**
- Brands above HUMBLE = direct threats
- "Growth Leaders" = emerging competition
- Large brands with negative growth = market share opportunity

**Strategic Questions:**
- What are competitors doing differently?
- Where are they stronger/weaker?
- Can we target their declining retailers?

---

### Analysis 4: "Are our promotions working?"

**Dashboard Path:** Promotional Analysis

**Key Metrics:**
1. **Promo Sales %** - What portion of sales come from promos?
2. **Promo Mix by Retailer** - Which retailers require more promo support?
3. **Promo Trend** - Is promotional dependency increasing?

**Targets:**
- Promo % between 25-40% = healthy
- Promo % >50% = over-dependent (margin risk)
- Promo % <15% = might be missing sales opportunities

**Optimization:**
- If Promo % is high but growth is flat → promotions aren't incremental
- If Non-promo sales are declining → base business eroding
- Compare promo % to competitors in Competitive Analysis

---

### Analysis 5: "What's our long-term trend?"

**Dashboard Path:** Trend Analysis

**Steps:**
1. Select "TOTAL US - NATURAL EXPANDED CHANNEL"
2. View "Sales Trend" chart
3. Check "YoY Growth Rate Trend"
4. Review distribution metrics over time

**Patterns to Identify:**
- **Consistent Growth** → Strategy is working, keep it up
- **Declining Trend** → Urgent intervention needed
- **Flat/Stagnant** → Need innovation or new distribution
- **Seasonal Patterns** → Plan marketing around peak seasons

**Strategic Actions:**
- Accelerating growth → invest more
- Decelerating growth → investigate root cause
- Cyclical patterns → align promo calendar

---

### Analysis 6: "How do we compare on pricing?"

**Dashboard Path:** Sales Performance

**Steps:**
1. Select HUMBLE as the brand
2. Check "Avg Price" metric
3. Go to Competitive Analysis
4. Calculate rough ARP for top competitors: Sales ÷ Units

**Pricing Strategy:**
- Premium to competitors → emphasize quality/differentiation
- At parity → compete on availability and promotions
- Below competitors → volume play, but watch margins

---

### Analysis 7: "Where should we expand distribution?"

**Dashboard Path:** Retailer Performance

**Steps:**
1. Look at ACV % column in scorecard
2. Identify retailers with <50% ACV
3. Check if sales are strong despite low ACV
4. Review "Sales vs Distribution" scatter plot

**Expansion Priority:**
- **High Sales + Low ACV** → Big opportunity, negotiate distribution
- **Growing retailer + Low ACV** → Get in early
- **High ACV + Low Sales** → Fix velocity first before more SKUs

---

### Analysis 8: "Is our growth outpacing the category?"

**Dashboard Path:** Competitive Analysis

**Steps:**
1. Select a retailer/channel
2. View top brands and their growth rates
3. Compare HUMBLE's YoY % to other brands
4. Check "Growth Leaders" section

**Benchmarking:**
- HUMBLE growth > Category average → gaining share ✓
- HUMBLE growth < Category average → losing share ✗
- All brands declining → category issue (not just us)

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Compare Time Periods**: Always look at 4-week (recent), 12-week (quarterly), and 52-week (annual) together

2. **Watch Velocity**: Sales per store is often more important than total sales

3. **Distribution First**: You can't sell where you're not on shelf - ACV matters

4. **Promo Balance**: Some promo is good, too much erodes base business

5. **Competitive Context**: Your performance is relative - always benchmark

6. **Trends Over Snapshots**: One bad week happens, but trends reveal truth

7. **Ask "Why?"**: Dashboard shows what's happening, you determine why

8. **Action-Oriented**: Every analysis should lead to a decision or action
